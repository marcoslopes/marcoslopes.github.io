                <p>Being the first backend/dev-ops member I have initially set the direction, framework and infrastructure to allow an efficient and effective delivery of our 1st product version.</p>
                <p>The Infrastructure automation that I set up utilises github actions where developers can take advantage of the same development lifecycle for triggering the 
                deployment to the N available environments.</p>
                <p>Infrastructure utilises several AWS components they are deployed with Terraform, requiring no developer's access to test/prod environments, and all steps are centralised and audited.</p>
                <p>Application framework utilises open-source libraries provided by the Rust community.</p>
                <p>I have also exercised on-boarding newer team members, and writing the documentation necessary to guarantee smooth business succession.</p>
